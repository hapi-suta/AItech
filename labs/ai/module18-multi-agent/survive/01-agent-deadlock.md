# Survive 01: Agent Deadlock

## The Scenario

Two agents wait on each other's output. Agent A (Diagnosis) needs Agent B's
(Classifier) category label before it can run root-cause analysis. Agent B needs
Agent A's enriched metric summary before it can classify. Neither can proceed.
The entire pipeline freezes for 45 minutes until an outer timeout kills both.
Three P1 alerts go unprocessed. The on-call DBA gets no notification.

## The Disaster

On your **Mac terminal**, run the failure scenario:

```bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'

# This script simulates the deadlock scenario so you can see exactly what happened.
# No real API calls are made - we simulate the waiting behavior with flags.

# threading lets us run two functions at the same time
# Think of it like two parallel database sessions running simultaneously
import threading

# time lets us pause execution - like pg_sleep() in PostgreSQL

## Investigate

On your **Mac terminal**, find the circular dependency:

```bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'

# This script shows how to detect a circular dependency using a depth-first search.
# DBA analogy: this is the same algorithm PostgreSQL uses internally to detect
# deadlocks between session lock graphs.

print("Investigation: Finding the Circular Dependency")
print("=" * 55)

print("""
How the cycle was introduced:

BEFORE (working - linear pipeline):
  Monitor -> Classifier -> Diagnosis -> Remediation
  Classifier ran first. It produced a category label.
  Diagnosis consumed that label to decide which metrics to analyze.

AFTER the feature change (broken - cycle):
  A developer added "metric enrichment" to the Classifier.
  The Classifier now wanted Diagnosis to pre-analyze raw metrics
  before the Classifier ran, so it could classify more accurately.
  But Diagnosis still needed Classifier's category to run.
  Result: A waits for B, B waits for A.

This is identical to the deadlock PostgreSQL detects between sessions:
  Session A holds lock on table_orders, wants lock on table_payments
  Session B holds lock on table_payments, wants lock on table_orders
  PostgreSQL kills one session and logs: "deadlock detected"
  Our agents had no equivalent protection.

## The Fix

Three changes prevent this from ever happening again.

### Fix 1: Validate the dependency graph at startup

On your **Mac terminal**, run:

```bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'

# Fix 1: Run the cycle-detection check BEFORE starting the pipeline.
# If a cycle is found, refuse to start and print the offending path.
# DBA analogy: like PostgreSQL refusing to start if postgresql.conf has invalid values.

            if result:
                return result
        in_path.discard(node)
        visited.add(node)
        return []

    for node in dependencies:
        cycle = dfs(node, [])
        if cycle:
            # Return False (not valid) and the cycle path

### Fix 2: Add timeouts to every inter-agent call

On your **Mac terminal**, run:

# If the answer does not arrive in time, use a safe fallback value and continue.
# DBA analogy: like statement_timeout in PostgreSQL.
#   SET statement_timeout = '30s';
#   Any query that runs longer than 30 seconds is automatically cancelled.
# The pipeline keeps moving; no agent can block everything indefinitely.

### Fix 3: Redesign the pipeline as a strict linear sequence

On your **Mac terminal**, run:

```bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'

# Fix 3: Remove the circular dependency by fixing the pipeline order.
# The Classifier no longer waits for Diagnosis.
# The Classifier runs first on raw metrics alone, produces a category,
# and then Diagnosis runs next using that category.
# Data flows in one direction only: forward.
# DBA analogy: like resolving a circular FK reference by introducing an intermediate table
# that breaks the cycle into two one-directional references.

print("Fix 3: Linear Pipeline (No Cycles)")
print("=" * 50)

print("""
BEFORE (broken - cycle):
  Monitor -> Classifier <-> Diagnosis -> Remediation
             (each waits on the other)

AFTER (fixed - linear):
  Monitor -> Classifier -> Diagnosis -> Remediation
  (each stage runs only after the previous one finishes)

The key change:
  Classifier was updated to work WITHOUT the enriched metric summary.
  It classifies based on the raw metric text alone.
  This is slightly less accurate but eliminates the deadlock entirely.
  Diagnosis then refines the analysis using the Classifier's category.

Design rule: in a multi-agent pipeline, dependencies must always
point forward. If you draw arrows showing which agent waits for which,
those arrows must never form a loop.

## What You Learned

| Problem | Why It Caused the Incident | Fix |
|---------|---------------------------|-----|
| Circular dependency between agents | Both agents waited forever - neither could start | Validate the dependency graph at startup; refuse to run if a cycle is found |
| No timeout on inter-agent calls | One blocked agent froze the entire pipeline for 45 minutes | Set a timeout on every agent call; use a safe fallback value if it expires |
| No dependency validation at deploy time | The cycle was invisible until the pipeline ran in production | Check the dependency graph in CI/CD before every deployment |
| Parallel agents with mutual dependencies | Running agents at the same time is safe only when they are independent | Agents that share data must run in sequence, not in parallel |
| No deadlock monitoring | 45 minutes passed before anyone noticed | Alert when any agent has been waiting more than 30 seconds |
