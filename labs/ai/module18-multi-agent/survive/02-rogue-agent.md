# Survive 02: Rogue Agent

## The Scenario

The remediation agent starts auto-executing medium-risk actions without approval.
A config file was copied from staging to production by mistake. The config set the
agent's safety level to `auto_execute_all` instead of `recommend_only`. The agent
did exactly what it was configured to do - in the wrong environment. It killed 12
active queries in 30 seconds. Three critical reports that were mid-generation are
gone. Two ETL jobs that had been running for hours must be restarted from scratch.

---

## The Disaster

On your **Mac terminal**, run the failure scenario:

```bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'

# This script simulates what the rogue agent did.
# We use a Python list as a mock "pg_stat_activity" table.
# The agent iterates the list and kills anything above its threshold.

# datetime lets us generate timestamps - like PostgreSQL's NOW()
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

print("""
Your multi-agent system runs in production with this config:

  remediation_agent:
    mode: recommend_only      <- correct for production
    min_query_duration_sec: 1800

On Tuesday, DevOps updates the staging config for load testing:

  remediation_agent:
    mode: auto_execute_all    <- OK for staging, NEVER for production
    min_query_duration_sec: 300

On Wednesday, DevOps runs this command to copy a different setting:
  cp staging/agent_config.yaml production/agent_config.yaml

The safety mode was in the same file as the other setting.
The agent restarts with the new production config.
Nobody notices until Thursday morning.

# If the config is unsafe for the environment, the agent raises an error and exits.

Fix 3: Emergency Kill Switch
==================================================

Before kill switch:
  Kill switch status: CLEAR
  [RemediationAgent] Executing [low]: SELECT pg_reload_conf()
  [RemediationAgent] Executing [medium]: SELECT pg_terminate_backend(12341)

DBA engages the kill switch after noticing rogue behavior:
  KILL SWITCH ENGAGED by hapopezi at 2026-06-09T14:30:00
  All agents are now in recommend_only mode.

After kill switch:
  Kill switch status: ENGAGED (by hapopezi at 2026-06-09T14:30:00)
  [RemediationAgent] KILL SWITCH ACTIVE - action blocked: SELECT pg_reload_conf()
  [RemediationAgent] KILL SWITCH ACTIVE - action blocked: SELECT pg_terminate_backend(12342)

Senior DBA investigates, fixes the config, clears the switch:
  KILL SWITCH CLEARED by hapopezi (verified config corrected)

Kill switch status after clear: CLEAR
  [RemediationAgent] Executing [low]: SELECT pg_reload_conf()
```

## What You Learned

| Problem | Why It Caused the Incident | Fix |
|---------|---------------------------|-----|
| Safety mode in the same file as other settings | A routine config copy silently overwrote the safety mode | Keep safety mode in a separate, access-controlled config file |
| No startup config validation | Agent started in `auto_execute_all` mode in production without any warning | Agent validates its own config on startup; refuses to run if the mode is not permitted |
| No approval workflow for medium-risk actions | Agent killed long-running queries without asking anyone | All medium and high-risk actions must be approved by a DBA before execution |
| No kill switch | 12 queries were killed before anyone could stop the agent | Any DBA can engage a kill switch that immediately blocks all agent actions |
| No alert on safety-mode changes in production | Nobody was notified when the config changed | Alert fires any time the safety mode changes on a production agent |
| No environment label in config files | Config intended for staging ran in production without detection | Every config file must declare its `intended_environment`; a mismatch blocks startup |
