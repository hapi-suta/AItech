# Build 03: Building an MCP Server

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets you build a tool server once and use it from any MCP client - Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or your own apps. Instead of defining tools in every script, you publish them as a service.

---

## Step 1. Install the MCP SDK

On your **Mac terminal**, run:

```bash
pip3 install mcp
```

Expected output (yours will differ):
```
Successfully installed mcp-1.27.2 ...
```

---

## Step 2. Build a DBA tools MCP server

This server exposes PostgreSQL monitoring tools that any MCP client can use.

```bash
cat > ~/Projects/AItech/labs/ai/module04-agents-and-mcp/build/dba_mcp_server.py << 'PYEOF'
"""
DBA Tools MCP Server
Exposes PostgreSQL monitoring and management tools via MCP.

Run: python3 dba_mcp_server.py
Test: Use with Claude Desktop or any MCP client.

# Create the MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("dba-tools", instructions="""

database health, check replication, analyze queries, and monitor
server metrics. Always gather data before making recommendations.

    mcp.run()
PYEOF
echo "MCP server saved to: ~/Projects/AItech/labs/ai/module04-agents-and-mcp/build/dba_mcp_server.py"
```

---

## Step 3. Test the MCP server tools locally

Before connecting to an MCP client, verify each tool works:

```bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'
# Import the tools directly and test them
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/Users/hafopezi/Projects/AItech/labs/ai/module04-agents-and-mcp/build")

# Test pg_isready
from dba_mcp_server import pg_isready, run_readonly_query, check_connections, check_database_size

print("=== pg_isready ===")
print(pg_isready())
print()

print("=== check_connections ===")
print(check_connections())
print()

print("=== check_database_size ===")
print(check_database_size())
print()

print("=== run_readonly_query (safe) ===")
print(run_readonly_query("SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"))
print()

print("=== run_readonly_query (blocked) ===")
print(run_readonly_query("DROP TABLE users;"))
PYEOF
```

Expected output (yours will differ):
```
=== pg_isready ===
/tmp:5432 - accepting connections

=== check_connections ===
idle,3
active,1
...

=== check_database_size ===
7 MB

=== run_readonly_query (safe) ===
4

=== run_readonly_query (blocked) ===
{"error": "Blocked: DROP queries not allowed. Read-only access only."}
```

Key things to notice:
- `pg_isready` talks to the real PostgreSQL on your Mac
- `check_connections` runs a real query against pg_stat_activity
- The `DROP TABLE` attempt is blocked by the safety check
- All tools produce usable output

---

## Step 4. Connect to Claude Desktop (optional)

If you have Claude Desktop installed, you can add this MCP server to it.

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dba-tools": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/Users/hafopezi/Projects/AItech/labs/ai/module04-agents-and-mcp/build/dba_mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. You'll see the DBA tools available in the conversation.

---

## Step 5. Understand the MCP architecture

```bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'
print("""
MCP Architecture:

                 Your MCP Server                   MCP Client (Claude)
              +-------------------+              +-------------------+
              |  pg_isready       |    stdio     | "What tools are   |
User  <--->   |  run_readonly_sql |  <-------->  |  available?"      |
              |  check_bloat      |   JSON-RPC   | "Call pg_isready"  |
              |  check_connections|              | "Here's the result"|
              +-------------------+              +-------------------+

Transport options:
  stdio  - Local process. Server runs as a subprocess of the client.
           Best for: Claude Desktop, local development.

  SSE    - Server Sent Events over HTTP. Server runs as a web service.
           Best for: Remote servers, shared team access.

Protocol:
  1. Client connects and asks: "What tools do you have?"
  2. Server responds with tool definitions (name, description, schema)
  3. Client (Claude) decides to call a tool
  4. Server executes the tool and returns results
  5. Repeat until the conversation ends

Key benefit: Build once, use everywhere.
  - Same server works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, your own apps
  - Tools are discoverable (clients don't need to know in advance)
  - Standard protocol (like HTTP for web apps)

## What You Learned

| Concept | What It Does | Production Use |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| FastMCP | Simple Python framework for MCP servers | Build tool servers fast |
| `@mcp.tool()` | Decorator that registers a function as MCP tool | Each function becomes an available tool |
| Safety checks | Block dangerous queries before execution | Prevent destructive actions |
| stdio transport | Local communication between client and server | Claude Desktop, development |
| SSE transport | HTTP-based remote communication | Production, shared servers |
| Tool discovery | Client auto-discovers available tools | No hardcoded tool lists |
