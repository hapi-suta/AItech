# Survive 02: Model Drift in Production

Three months after launch, dbaBrain's accuracy has silently dropped from 92% to 71%. No one noticed because overall request metrics (latency, error rate) look fine. The accuracy degradation happened gradually - 1-2% per week - and only shows up when you compare DBA corrections over time.

## The Disaster

On your **Mac terminal**, run the failure scenario:

```bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'
print("""
SCENARIO: Silent Model Drift

Your AI product has been running in production for 3 months.
Everything LOOKS healthy:
  - API latency: 18ms p95 (target: < 200ms)  CHECK
  - Error rate: 0.1% (target: < 1%)           CHECK
  - Uptime: 99.97% (target: 99.9%)            CHECK

But accuracy has been silently degrading:
  Week 1:  92% overall accuracy
  Week 4:  89% accuracy (still above 90% target? barely)
  Week 8:  82% accuracy (below target, no alert fired)
  Week 12: 71% accuracy (DBAs stop trusting the system)

What happened? The production data CHANGED, but the model didn't.

Pattern:
  - Replication accuracy dropped fastest (88% -> 54%)
  - Connectivity accuracy dropped second (90% -> 59%)
  - Performance, storage, security, backup held up better

Why? The infrastructure team deployed Patroni (HA cluster manager)
in week 3. Patroni changed the alert text patterns:
  Before: "Replication lag on standby pg-standby-1"
  After:  "Patroni: node pg-standby-1 timeline diverged, needs rewind"

The keyword "replication" no longer appears in many replication alerts.
The classifier doesn't know words like "patroni", "timeline", "rewind".

Similarly, pgBouncer was upgraded in week 5:
  Before: "Connection pool exhausted, max_connections reached"
  After:  "pgbouncer: server connection limit reached for database app_db"

New vocabulary, same problems. The model is stuck in the past.

## Investigate

On your **Mac terminal**, find the root cause:

```bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'
print("Investigation: Why Accuracy Drifted")
print("=" * 55)

print("""
Root Cause: Data Drift (Production Data Changed, Model Didn't)

Three types of drift happened simultaneously:

1. VOCABULARY DRIFT (text patterns changed)
   - Patroni introduced new terms: "timeline", "rewind", "switchover"
   - pgBouncer upgrade changed error messages
   - New monitoring tools added different alert formats

2. METRIC DRIFT (new metrics appeared)
   - Patroni sends: "patroni_lag_bytes" instead of "replication_lag_seconds"
   - pgBouncer sends: "pool_waiting" instead of "connections"
   - New metrics the model never saw during training

3. DISTRIBUTION DRIFT (alert mix changed)
   - Before Patroni: 15% replication alerts
   - After Patroni: 25% replication alerts (more granular monitoring)
   - Categories the model was weakest at became more common

Why nobody noticed:
  1. No accuracy monitoring (only latency and error rate were tracked)
  2. No per-category accuracy tracking
  3. No drift detection (comparing current data to training data)
  4. DBA feedback was collected but not analyzed automatically
  5. The degradation was gradual (1-2% per week)

DBA analogy: like a slow memory leak.
  Week 1: 2 GB free
  Week 8: 500 MB free
  Week 12: OOM kill
  If you only monitor "is PostgreSQL running?", you miss the leak.
  You need to monitor the TREND, not just the current state.

Layer 3: Keyword Refresh Process
{'=' * 50}

When drift is detected, update keywords:

  1. Collect unknown words from drift detector
  2. Have senior DBA review and categorize them:
     - "patroni" -> replication
     - "switchover" -> replication
     - "pgbouncer" -> connectivity
     - "reserve pool" -> connectivity
  3. Add approved keywords to the model
  4. Run the test suite to verify improvement
  5. Deploy new version through normal pipeline

This is NOT an emergency. It's a maintenance task.
Schedule it weekly or when drift score exceeds 0.3.

Layer 4: Retraining Pipeline
{'=' * 50}

Monthly retraining process:
  1. Export all DBA-confirmed classifications (ground truth)
  2. Include corrections (DBA-corrected misclassifications)
  3. Update keyword lists based on new vocabulary
  4. Update metric thresholds based on new patterns
  5. Run full test suite (unit + integration + behavioral)
  6. Compare accuracy to current production model
  7. Deploy ONLY if accuracy improves (quality gate)

Prevention checklist:
  1. Monitor accuracy TRENDS, not just current values
  2. Track per-category accuracy (overall can hide problems)
  3. Detect vocabulary drift (new terms the model doesn't know)
  4. Schedule regular keyword reviews (weekly or monthly)
  5. Retrain on real production data (not just original training data)
  6. Quality gates prevent deploying worse models
  7. Alert when any category drops below 80% accuracy

DBA analogy:
  Model drift = index bloat. Performance degrades slowly.
  If you only check "is the query running?", you miss the bloat.
  You need: pg_stat_user_indexes + REINDEX schedule.
  Same for AI: accuracy monitoring + retraining schedule.

## What You Learned

| Problem | Why It's Dangerous | Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----|
| Vocabulary drift | New tools change alert text, model can't classify | Drift detection + keyword refresh |
| No accuracy monitoring | Drift is invisible until DBAs lose trust | Per-category accuracy trends |
| Gradual degradation | 1-2% per week doesn't trigger alerts | Trend analysis over sliding window |
| No retraining process | Model frozen at launch-day knowledge | Monthly retraining on production data |
| Overall accuracy hides problems | 92% overall but 54% on replication | Per-category tracking with minimum thresholds |
